# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Configuration.json
* DOG_SEARCH.MAX_AGE: This controls what the max age that's treated as "include all dogs". If I had control over the API this would be a supported call.
* CONNECTION.SERVER_URL: THis is the url of the API provided. While in this specific project this will never need to change in a production setting this would need to be configurable. Normally this would be handled with secrets, given hosting limitations this is just listed in the configuration.

## Before running makes sure to run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
